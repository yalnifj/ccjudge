<h2>Help During a Contest</h2>

<li>Interpretation of sample data</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Help Before a Contest</h2>

<li>You should train on practice problems and reference other resources</li>
<li>You should have a coach help you to train and practice</li>
<li>You should gather books and resources that you think will help you during the competition</li>
</ul>

<h2>Scoring</h2>
<ul>
<li>The winning team will be the one who correctly solves the most problems.</li>
<li>In the event of a tie, the team who completed their problems the fastest will win.</li>
<li>Timing is determined by the number of minutes elapsed since the start of the competition and the correct submission.</li>
